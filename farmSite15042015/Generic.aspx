                        <p>Rachel and I had such a great time volunteering on the farm for just one week with Simheswara and the rest of the volunteers and workers! The accommodation and food is brilliant and Simheswara always makes sure everyone is okay. The work is easy, enjoyable and very flexible with no pressure - just an awesome atmosphere! Even better with all the Govardhan festival activities we were involved with! You can also learn a lot about Krishna consciousness, it's really interesting! See you again!
Hare Krishna! </p>
