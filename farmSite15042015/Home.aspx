                        <p> "Our farm projects are an extremely important part of our movement. We must become self-sufficient by growing our own grains and producing our own milk, then there will be no question of poverty. So develop these farm communities as far as possible. They should be developed as an ideal society depending on natural products not industry.

                            <i>- Srila Prabhupada, Letter to Rupanuga, 18 December, 1974</i>

                            <br />

                            As Prabhupada noted above, New Godhruma Dhama is certainly one of those farms. Please come, visit & explore on it!

But to experience the original mood of the celebration one will definitely need to be at a farm setting where there are abundant cows, trees, hills and ponds. 
                           At New Godruma Dhama farm the regular farm employees from Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Nepal, and volunteer workers from Denmark, Germany and Italy joined the first part of the Ponggal celebration at the sugar cane plantation at 7AM.

                        <p>Hare Krishna. A bus load of children and youths of the Sri Ganesar Alayam Kampung Pandan visited our farm on 14th December for a programme of kirtan, bhajan, Bhagavad-gita introduction, japa, breakfast, planting of trees, feeding mother cows, brushing them, bathing them and of course playing with them. The group will then be taught how to make cow dung patties. They will also visit the tapioca chips factory and a for a short while be engaged in tapioca chips making and packing. This will be followed with boating for youths. The group members will then take lunch and proceed to the National Elephant Sanctuary at Kuala Gandah about 30 minutes drive from our farm. This is a FARM-ILY DAY, a day with Krishna's cows and land. What better way to enjoy a day with your family and friends.</p>

                        <p>Protecting cows is one of the  most important activities of the New Godhruma Dhama Community. The Vedas, Saints, Sadhus, and Lord Krishna himself proclaim that service and protection of Mother Cow is the greatest solution for mankind's suffering, the path to real peace.</p>

                            <p>Rachel and I had such a great time volunteering on the farm for just one week with Simheswara and the rest of the volunteers and workers! The accommodation and food is brilliant and Simheswara always makes sure everyone is okay. The work is easy, enjoyable and very flexible with no pressure - just an awesome atmosphere! Even better with all the Govardhan festival activities we were involved with! You can also learn a lot about Krishna consciousness, it's really interesting! See you again!
Hare Krishna!.</p>

The surroundings and atmosphere are very relaxing, making my stay feel more like a break from travel than work. The workday is very manageable, and the food and accommodation is well above par. Thanks to Simheswara and the workers for the warm welcome and for answering our questions about Hare Krishna beliefs and practices. Thanks for a great workaway experience..</p>
